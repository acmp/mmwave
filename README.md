  Thanks to crlogic for the post, it was really helpful
  
Board design is compact and intended for small stand alone presence sensors. The resistor positions are to allow support for older ESP-01 units, they are not required for ESP-01s

I'd recommend panlising this board if you send it for manufacture, you will get a lot more boards for not much extra cost.

Remember to program your ESP-01s before adding it to this board. You can use sockets if you want to be able to change the ESP at a later date, same with the LD2410
