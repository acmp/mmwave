  Theres some good info here, but its not what i used. still looking for that:

Board design is compact and intended for small stand alone presence sensors. The resistor positions are to allow support for older ESP-01 units, they are not required for ESP-01s

I'd recommend panlising this board if you send it for manufacture, you will get a lot more boards for not much extra cost.

Remember to program your ESP-01s before adding it to this board. You can use sockets if you want to be able to change the ESP at a later date, same with the LD2410
